# Attest for iOS Mobile Application
The integration test suite for the Attest for iOS product. Also serves as examples and documentation
of best practices on how to use the Attest for iOS Automated Accessibility Scanning Library. The application
itself is a very simple series of ViewControllers that aim to demo one aspect of accessibility api usage.
Within each example is a demo of how to misuse iOS APIs and how to use them properly.
