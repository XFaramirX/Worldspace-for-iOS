# WorldSpace for iOS Developers - Demo Application
This repository also serves as documentation for Deque's Attest for iOS Accessibility Analysis Framework. It is a simple iOS application which contains a series of ViewControllers that demonstrate the types of Accessibility Issues the Attest for iOS Accessibility Analysis Framework looks for when it does an analysis. While being an easy place to start, you are also welcome to grab the framework (see Fetching Framework in the Wiki) and build it against your own application directly.

For instructions on how to build this repository and use the Attest Framework see the [Wiki](https://github.com/dequelabs/Worldspace-for-iOS/wiki/)!

## Sign Up for Free Trial

In order to build this repository, you will need access to the Attest iOS Framework. If you are a customer, utilize your Artifactory API key. IF not, sign up for a [free trial](https://accessibility.deque.com/ios-accessibility-testing-free-trial) to receive an API Key that will give you access to a limited version of the library.

NOTE: The version of the framework you will fetch is functionally limited. You will get reports from every rule on the number of violations, but will only get debugging information for the Color Contrast rule. The API for the limited and full versions are identical and transitioning to the full version is trivial. Contact a Deque representative if you're interested in licensing WorldSpace for iOS and gaining access to this information for the other rules.
