# WorldSpace for iOS Developers - Demo Application
This repository also serves as documentation for Deque's Attest for iOS Accessibility Analysis Framework. It is a simple iOS application which contains a series of ViewControllers that demonstrate the types of Accessibility Issues the Attest for iOS Accessibility Analysis Framework looks for when it does an analysis. While being an easy place to start, you are also welcome to grab the framework (see Fetching Framework in the Wiki) and build it against your own application directly.

For a free trial API Key visit our [signup page](https://accessibility.deque.com/ios-accessibility-testing-free-trial).

For instructions on how to build this repository and use the Attest Framework see the [Wiki](https://github.com/dequelabs/Worldspace-for-iOS/wiki/)!
