# WorldSpace for iOS Developers - Demo Application
This application contains a series of simple ViewControllers that demonstrates the types of Accessibility Issues the WorldSpace for iOS Framework looks for when it does an analysis. This repository also serves as documentation on how to link to and build accessibility tests against an application. While being the easiest place to start, you are also welcome to grab the framework (see Fetching Framework in the Wiki) and build it against your own application directly. 

For more information about how to use the Framework, please see the [Wiki](https://github.com/dequelabs/Worldspace-for-iOS/wiki/)!

NOTE: The version of the framework you will fetch is functionally limited. You will get reports from every rule on the number of violations, but will only get debugging information for the Color Contrast rule. Contact a Deque representative if you're interested in licensing WorldSpace for iOS and gaining access to this information for the other rules.
